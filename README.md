# eleventy-data-starter
This is a starter template if you want to work with JSON data.
If you're wondering why I've used the term badgesm because I will be using it for rendering badges. 

This starter generate a frontpage with all values from all pages displayed.
In the 'badge' folder you can find all the single badges. 

## Run
eleventy --serve

## 11ty Basics

> A barebones demo of basic but essential 11ty features.

This was created to support the [livestream walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2By887u7b0A) with [@edieblu](https://www.twitch.tv/edieblu).

> Check out the ["Steps to Create From Scratch"](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-basics/blob/master/StepsToCreate.md) which match the livestreamed steps. For a more full in-depth tutorial, review the post on 11ty.Rocks: "[Create Your First Basic 11ty Website](https://11ty.rocks/posts/create-your-first-basic-11ty-website/)"

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS and social preview image generation

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
